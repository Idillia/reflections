What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It helps to track all the information and history about files.
It will allow us use git commands.

git init


git status

git add

git reset

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
I guess it is sanety check just to make sure that user wants to save those particular files and versions.
