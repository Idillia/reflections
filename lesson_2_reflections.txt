What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It helps to track all the information and history about files.
It will allow us use git commands.

git init


git status

git add

git reset

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
I guess it is sanety check just to make sure that user wants to save those particular files and versions.

Reverse git checkout commit id to original:
git checkout master

Compare a file that is in working directory to the same file in staging area(if present):
git diff (no args)

Compare a file that is in staging area to the most recent commit in repositrory:
git diff --staged

Resets all the files in working repo and staging area to the enetial state. !!! Can not be reversed:
git reset --hard

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Stage only file or files that have linked changes.

Command that showes current branch:
git branch

Command that creates new branch:
git branch newidillia:

Switch to the desired branch:
git checkout newidillia

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
I'm not sure about ornanized the history but it help with creating sevral experimental versions and allow to try diffrent things.
