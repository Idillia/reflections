Steps to create and push local repo to github

1. Create repo on github. If we are going to push some repo with commits no need to add readme.
2. mila (master) reflections $ git remote add origin https://github.com/Idillia/reflections.git
3. mila (master) reflections $ git remote (should show word origin)
4. More verbose information
	mila (master) reflections $git remote -v
Showes:
origin	https://github.com/Idillia/reflections.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/Idillia/reflections.git (push)
5. mila (master) reflections $ git push origin master	

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I will use remote when I collaborate with the other people on the same project which can be access from remote repo.
